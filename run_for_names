import json 
path = "/Users/michaelcantu/Desktop/Quarter_5/Data_Science_Pipeline/data/yelp_dataset/"
states = {}
###read lines lets us just go through the json file, we wont have to use with open.
for i in open(path+ "business.json").readlines():
    ###loads the json string into an actual dictionary for python 
    data = json.loads(i)
    ##just dropping the values of the key state into the empty dictionary you created
    ###Below in this if statement iss apprentyl how you append or add things into a dictionary
    ###???but confused as it looks like its just asking the question if the value of state is in 
    ###States.keys which i thought was empty.
    ###if it s empty then 
    if data["city"] in states.keys():
        states[data['city']] = states[data['city']] + 1
    else:
        states[data["city"]] = 1
    ##///states.append(data['states'])
##how do i put/append json value from data into empty dictionary?
    
print((states))
v = []
for d in states.keys():
    v.append(d)
    print(v)
